# Sign-source-code-head---WordPress-plugin
WordPress plugin that adds a little HTML comment to the head tag.
Just fork the plugin, change my name to yours on the comment and you are good to go.

This plugin is intended for those projects you can't sign in the footer (like when you are working for 3rd parties or 
when you client doesn't to include your name for some reason). This way, you still demonstrate you worked on the website.
Very handy for those job applications where they want you to prove your participation in a project.
